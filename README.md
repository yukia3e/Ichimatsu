# Ichimatsu

## About

"Ichimatsu" is the first step for live music artists to explore new possibilities with web3.

- Account creation as smooth as Web2's UX
- Easily generate NFTs to commemorate events from "a single image file."
- Sponsoring gas transactions allows you to get started even if you don't have cryptocurrency.

### Origin of the name "ichimatsu"

- 市松模様 (ichimatsu-moyou): A check pattern consisting of alternating squares or rectangles of two colors. Because the way continues without interruption, it means "eternity and prosperity."

- 一抹 (ichimatsu): It means "just a little."

We named the service to be such a service that "a little Step for artists can boost their sustainable and enduring artist activities."
