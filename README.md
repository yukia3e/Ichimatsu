# Ichimatsu

## About

"Ichimatsu" is the first step for live music artists to explore new possibilities with web3.

- Account creation as smooth as Web2's UX
- Easily generate NFTs to commemorate events from "a single image file."
- Sponsoring gas transactions allows you to get started even if you don't have cryptocurrency.

### Origin of the name "ichimatsu"

- Â∏ÇÊùæÊ®°Êßò (ichimatsu-moyou): A check pattern consisting of alternating squares or rectangles of two colors. Because the way continues without interruption, it means "eternity and prosperity."

- ‰∏ÄÊäπ (ichimatsu): It means "just a little."

We named the service to be such a service that "a little Step for artists can boost their sustainable and enduring artist activities."

## Features

- Whether you already have a wallet or not, you can start your Web3 experience with Web2-like ease!
- This is recommended for artists who have not started with NFTs because they are confused about how to prepare NFTs from a single photo.
  - You can easily make your LIVE memories into digital collectibles by dividing and presenting photos from your events.
